This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve all other modules. The application intercats with two databases-MYSQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongDB (for prescriptions). All controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn delegates to the appropriate repositories. MYSQL uses JPA entities while MongoDB uses document models.
